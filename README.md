            Media Queries and somewhat Grid layout
            Take the theory I've learnt and apply them practically with real world examples
            Coding in general , is a necessity for the degree I will be persuing.
            Asking for help more often, I am the type to fake it till i make it


2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Describe your key interests related to your career.
        The concept of cloud achitecture and how we need to keep all data in transit secure and unfragmented
    - What values are important to you in a work environment?
        Honesty , Conducive Working environment and benefits. 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - List the industries or roles you have researched.
        Junior developer positions and anything entry-level IT based
    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.
        Teaching IT to kids , due to prior experience I think I would like to mold minds in a more positive light. Teaching what ive learn in general too , I often explain what ive learnt to my family to further soldify broadening my knowledge base.
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.
        Codespace grant the support to grasp the new concepts as opposed to prior learning institutes where it was insisted to memorize all coding concepts. Fortunately with CodeSpace Googling is encouraged rather than frowned upon. 
    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
        level of experience was always the shortfall, and exposure to work environments.
        I do hope that after all projects a class is dedicated to showing corrections to past projects to clarify confusion ,and in my case overcomplicating code. 

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
        Complete this SDF course , probably gp further into the next program. My goal for choosing codespace for coding was that past universities/colleges i was enrolled in did not focus too much on or did not grant sufficient support for it.

        Upskill myself to become more attractive in the job market so i will be able to work , have an income then finally pursue my interest for Culiary Arts so i have something to fall back on. Dont get me wrong i do enjoy information technology for some reason coding gives me the heebie jeebies. But not for long!

        IT is becoming more frequent in our society it would be wise to upscale myself than to moan about how difficult it is to find work. I want the luxury to afford bread ,and fuel too, in this economy/climate.
    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Outline your long-term career aspirations.
        I would thereafter continue to pursue my degree given that the coding/programming section of it was attended to. A degree in Cyber-Security. Either another Degree in Culinary or some short courses under my belt.
    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.
        Gaining these skills enable me to apply confidently for interviews. Have job security and learn new things as IT evolves. As an aside IT is everywhere , when i start with a booming culinary business i wouldnt need to employ someone to design my website for me.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.
        Prioritize more time to learning so that the information sticks , practise causes muscle memory.
    - Include any resources or support required.
         After all the projects please can we dedicate time to correct confusion and over-cmplication if it is possible . I think my results will be better.
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
        - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
         Do so well with this course that adding it to my CV will gain attention .
    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.
        Short courses on running small to medium business. Get my degree in Cyber Security.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
         Burnout, memorizing without realising instead of understanding content.
    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.
        Take routine breaks and give myself time.
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
    - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.
        Google opportunities along this career path
        attend the online-remote seminars provided on Discord by CodeSpaceover googleMeets and Teams Calls.
        in some instances i would need to volunteer my time to gain experince which is fine.
